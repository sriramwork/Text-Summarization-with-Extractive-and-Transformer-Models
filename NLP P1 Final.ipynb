Estimating the entropy of a discrete distribution from samples is an important and difficult problem that has received considerable   attention in statistics and theoretical neuroscience.  However,  neural responses have characteristic statistical structure that   generic entropy estimators fail to exploit.  For example, existing  Bayesian entropy estimators make the naive assumption that all spike   words are equally likely a priori, which makes for an  inefficient allocation of prior probability mass in cases where   spikes are sparse.  Here we develop Bayesian estimators for the  entropy of binary spike trains using priors designed to flexibly   exploit the statistical structure of simultaneously-recorded spike  responses.  We define two prior distributions over spike words using   mixtures of Dirichlet distributions centered on simple parametric  models.  The parametric model captures high-level statistical   features of the data, such as the average spike count in a spike  word, which allows the posterior over entropy to concentrate more   rapidly than with standard estimators (e.g., in cases where the  probability of spiking differs strongly from 0.5). Conversely, the   Dirichlet distributions assign prior mass to distributions far from  the parametric model, ensuring consistent estimates for arbitrary   distributions.  We devise a compact representation of the data and  prior that allow for computationally efficient implementations of   Bayesian least squares and empirical Bayes entropy estimators with  large numbers of neurons.  We apply these estimators to simulated   and real neural data and show that they substantially outperform  traditional methods.\",\n          \"Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are probabilistic models over all subsets a ground set of N items. They have recently gained prominence in several applications that rely on diverse subsets. However, their applicability to large problems is still limited due to O(N^3) complexity of core tasks such as sampling and learning. We enable efficient sampling and learning for DPPs by introducing KronDPP, a DPP model whose kernel matrix decomposes as a tensor product of multiple smaller kernel matrices. This decomposition immediately enables fast exact sampling. But contrary to what one may expect, leveraging the Kronecker product structure for speeding up DPP learning turns out to be more difficult. We overcome this challenge, and derive batch and stochastic optimization algorithms for efficiently learning the parameters of a KronDPP.\",\n          \"We consider the problem of finding the minimizer of a convex function $F: \\\\mathbb R^d \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb R$ of the form $F(w) \\\\defeq \\\\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(w) + R(w)$ where a low-rank factorization of $\\\\nabla^2 f_i(w)$ is readily available.We consider the regime where $n \\\\gg d$.

Bounding the treewidth of a Bayesian\\nnetwork greatly reduces the complexity of inferences. Yet, being a global property\\nof the graph, it considerably increases the difficulty of the learning process. Our\\nnovel algorithm accomplishes this task, scaling both to large domains and to large\\ntreewidths. Our novel approach consistently outperforms the state of the art on\\nexperiments with up to thousands of variables.\\n\\n1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nWe consider the problem of structural learning of Bayesian networks with bounded treewidth,\\nadopting a score-based approach. Learning the structure of a bounded treewidth Bayesian network is\\nan NP-hard problem (Korhonen and Parviainen, 2013). Yet learning Bayesian networks with bounded\\ntreewidth is necessary to allow exact tractable inference, since the worst-case inference complexity is\\nexponential in the treewidth k (under the exponential time hypothesis) (Kwisthout et al., 2010).\\nA pioneering approach, polynomial in both the number of variables and the treewidth bound, has\\nbeen proposed in Elidan and Gould (2009). It incrementally builds the network; at each arc addition\\nit provides an upper-bound on the treewidth of the learned structure. The limit of this approach is that,\\nas the number of variables increases, the gap between the bound and the actual treewidth becomes\\nlarge, leading to sparse networks. An exact method has been proposed in Korhonen and Parviainen\\n(2013), which finds the highest-scoring network with the desired treewidth. However, its complexity\\nincreases exponentially with the number of variables n. Thus it has been applied in experiments with\\n15 variables at most. Parviainen et al. (2014) adopted an anytime integer linear programming (ILP)\\napproach, called TWILP. If the algorithm is given enough time, it finds the highest-scoring network\\nwith bounded treewidth. Otherwise it returns a sub-optimal DAG with bounded treewidth. The ILP\\nproblem has an exponential number of constraints in the number of variables; this limits its scalability,\\neven if the constraints can be generated online. Berg et al. (2014) casted the problem of structural\\nlearning with limited treewidth as a problem of weighted partial Maximum Satisfiability. They solved\\nthe problem exactly through a MaxSAT solver and performed experiments with 30 variables at most.\\nNie et al. (2014) proposed an efficient anytime ILP approach with a polynomial number of constraints\\n?\\n\\nIstituto Dalle Molle di studi sull?Intelligenza Artificiale (IDSIA)\\nScuola universitaria professionale della Svizzera italiana (SUPSI)\\n?\\nUniversit? della Svizzera italiana (USI)\\n?\\n\\n30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.\\n\\n\\fin the number of variables. Yet they report that the quality of the solutions quickly degrades as the\\nnumber of variables exceeds a few dozens and that no satisfactory solutions are found with data sets\\ncontaining more than 50 variables. Approximate approaches are therefore needed to scale to larger\\ndomains.\\nNie et al. (2015) proposed the method S2. It exploits the notion of k-tree, which is an undirected\\nmaximal graph with treewidth k. A Bayesian network whose moral graph is a subgraph of a k-tree\\nhas treewidth bounded by k. S2 is an iterative algorithm. Each iteration consists of two steps: a)\\nsampling uniformly a k-tree from the space of k-trees and b) recovering a DAG whose moral graph\\nis a sub-graph of the most promising sampled k-tree. The goodness of the k-tree is assessed via a\\nso-called informative score. Nie et al. (2016) further refine this idea, obtaining via A* the k-tree\\nwhich maximizes the informative score. This algorithm is called S2+.\\nRecent structural learning algorithms with unbounded treewidth (Scanagatta et al., 2015) can cope\\nwith thousands of variables. Yet the unbounded treewidth provides no guarantee about the tractability\\nof the inferences of the learned models. We aim at filling this gap, learning treewidth-bounded\\nBayesian network models in domains with thousands of variables.\\nWe propose two novel methods for learning Bayesian networks with bounded treewidth. They exploit\\nthe fact that any k-tree can be constructed by an iterative procedure that adds one variable at a time.\\nWe propose an iterative procedure that, given an order on the variables, builds a DAG G adding one\\nvariable at a time. The moral graph of G is ensured to be subgraph of a k-tree. The k-tree is designed\\nas to maximize the score of the resulting DAG. This is a major difference with respect to previous\\nworks (Nie et al., 2015, 2016) in which the k-trees were randomly sampled. We propose both an\\nexact and an approximated variant of our algorithm; the latter is necessary to scale to thousands of\\nvariables.\\nWe discuss that the search space of the presented algorithms does not span the whole space of\\nbounded-treewidth DAGs. Yet our algorithms consistently outperform the state-of-the-art competitors\\nfor structural learning with bounded treewidth. For the first time we present experimental results for\\nstructural learning with bounded treewidth for domains involving up to ten thousand variables.\\nSoftware and supplementary material are available from http://blip.idsia.ch.\\n\\n2\\n\\nStructural learning\\n\\nConsider the problem of learning the structure of a Bayesian network from a complete data set of N\\ninstances D = {D1 , ..., DN }. The set of n categorical random variables is X = {X1 , ..., Xn }. The\\ngoal is to find the best DAG G = (V, E), where V is the collection of nodes and E is the collection\\nof arcs. E can be represented by the set of parents ?1 , ..., ?n of each variable.\\nDifferent scores can be used to assess the fit of a DAG; we adopt the Bayesian information criterion\\n(or simply BIC). The BIC score is decomposable, being constituted by the sum of the scores of the\\nindividual variables:\\n\\nBIC(G) =\\n=\\n\\nn\\nX\\n\\nBIC(Xi , ?i ) =\\n\\ni=1\\nn X\\nX\\n\\n(\\n\\ni=1\\n\\nn\\nX\\n\\n(LL(Xi |?i ) + Pen(Xi , ?i )) =\\n\\ni=1\\n\\nlog N\\nNx,? ??x|? ?\\n(|Xi | ? 1)(|?i |))\\n??|?i |,x?|Xi |\\n2\\n\\nwhere ??x|? is the maximum likelihood estimate of the conditional probability P (Xi = x|?i = ?),\\nNx,? represents the number of times (X = x ? ?i = ?) appears in the data set, and | ? | indicates the\\nsize of the Cartesian product space of the variables given as argument. Thus |Xi | is the number of\\nstates of Xi and |?i | is the product of the number of states of the parents of Xi .\\nExploiting decomposability, we first identify independently for each variable a list of candidate\\nparent sets (parent set identification). Later, we select for each node the parent set that yields the\\nhighest-scoring treewidth-bounded DAG (structure optimization).\\n2\\n\\n\\f2.1\\n\\nTreewidth and k-trees\\n\\nWe illustrate the concept of treewidth following the notation of Elidan and Gould (2009). We\\ndenote an undirected graph as H = (V, E) where V is the vertex set and E is the edge set. A tree\\ndecomposition of H is a pair (C, T ) where C = {C1 , C2 , ..., Cm } is a collection of subsets of V and\\nT is a tree on C, so that:\\n? ?m\\ni=1 Ci = V ;\\n? for every edge which connects the vertices v1 and v2 , there is a subset Ci which contains\\nboth v1 and v2 ;\\n? for all i, j, k in {1, 2, ..m} if Cj is on the path between Ci and Ck in T then Ci ? Ck ? Cj .\\nThe width of a tree decomposition is max(|Ci |) ? 1 where |Ci | is the number of vertices in Ci . The\\ntreewidth of H is the minimum width among all possible tree decompositions of G.\\nThe treewidth can be equivalently defined in terms of a triangulation of H. A triangulated graph is an\\nundirected graph in which every cycle of length greater than three contains a chord. The treewidth of\\na triangulated graph is the size of the maximal clique of the graph minus one. The treewidth of H is\\nthe minimum treewidth over all the possible triangulations of H.\\nThe treewidth of a Bayesian network is characterized with respect to all possible triangulations of its\\nmoral graph. The moral graph M of a DAG is an undirected graph that includes an edge i ? j for\\nevery edge i ? j in the DAG and an edge p ? q for every pair of edges p ? i, q ? i in the DAG.\\nThe treewidth of a DAG is the minimum treewidth over all the possible triangulations of its moral\\ngraph M . Thus the maximal clique of any moralized triangulation of G is an upper bound on the\\ntreewidth of the model.\\nk-trees An undirected graph Tk = (V, E) is a k-tree if it is a maximal graph of tree-width k: any\\nedge added to Tk increases its treewidth. A k-tree is inductively defined as follows (Patil, 1986).\\nConsider a (k + 1)-clique, namely a complete graph with k + 1 nodes. A (k + 1)-clique is a k-tree. A\\n(k + 1)-clique can be decomposed into multiple k-cliques. Let us denote by z a node not yet included\\nin the list of vertices V . Then the graph obtained by connecting z to every node of a k-clique of Tk\\nis also a k-tree. The treewidth of any subgraph of a k-tree (partial k-tree) is bounded by k. Thus a\\nDAG whose moral graph is subgraph of a k-tree has treewidth bounded by k.\\n\\n3\\n\\nIncremental treewidth-bounded structure learning\\n\\nOur approach for the structure optimization task proceeds by repeatedly sampling an order ? over\\nthe variables and then identifying the highest-scoring DAG with bounded treewidth consistent with\\nthe order. An effective approach for structural learning based on order sampling has been introduced\\nby Teyssier and Koller (2012); however it does not enforce any treewidth constraint.\\nThe size of the search space of orders is n!; this is smaller than the search space of the k-trees,\\nO(enlog(nk) ). Once the order ? is sampled, we incrementally learn the DAG. At each iteration the\\nmoralization of the DAG is by design a subgraph of a k-tree. The treewidth of the DAG eventually\\nobtained is thus bounded by k. The algorithm proceeds as follows.\\nInitialization The initial k-tree Kk+1 is constituted by the complete clique over the first k + 1\\nvariables in the order. The initial DAG Gk+1 is learned over the same k + 1 variables. Since (k + 1)\\nis a tractable number of variables, we exactly learn Gk+1 adopting the method of Cussens (2011).\\nThe moral graph of Gk+1 is a subgraph of Kk+1 and thus Gk+1 has bounded treewidth.\\nAddition of the subsequent nodes We then iteratively add each remaining variable in the order.\\nConsider the next variable in the order, X?i , where i ? {k + 2, ..., n}. Let us denote by Gi?1\\nand Ki?1 the DAG and the k-tree which have to be updated by adding X?i . We add X?i to Gi?1 ,\\nconstraining its parent set ??i to be a k-clique (or a subset of) in Ki?1 . This yields the updated DAG\\nGi . We then update the k-tree, connecting X?i to such k-clique. This yields the k-tree Ki ; it contains\\nan additional k + 1-clique compared to Ki?1 . By construction, Ki is also a k-tree. The moral graph\\nof Gi cannot add arc outside this (k + 1)-clique; thus it is a subgraph of Ki .\\nPruning orders The initial k-tree Kk+1 and the initial DAG Gk+1 depend on which are the first\\nk + 1 variables in the order, but not on their relative positions. Thus all the orders which differ only\\n3\\n\\n\\fas for the relative position of the first k + 1 elements are equivalent for our algorithm: they yield the\\nsame Kk+1 and Gk+1 . Thus once we sample an order and perform structural learning, we prune the\\n(k + 1)! ? 1 orders which are equivalent to the current one.\\nIn order to choose the parent set to be assigned to each variable added to the graph we propose two\\nalgorithms: k-A* and k-G.\\n3.1\\n\\nk-A*\\n\\nWe formulate the problem as a shortest path finding problem. We define each state as a step towards\\nthe completion of the structure, where a new variable is added to the DAG G. Given X?i the variable\\nassigned in the state S, we define a successor state of S for each k-clique to which we can link\\nX?i+1 . The approach to solve the problem is based on a path-finding A* search, with cost function\\nfor state S defined as f (S) = g(S) + h(S). The goal is to find the state which minimizes f (S) once\\nall variables have been assigned.\\nWe define g(S) and h(S) as:\\ng(S) =\\n\\ni\\nX\\n\\nscore(X?j ,??j ) ,\\n\\nh(S) =\\n\\nn\\nX\\n\\nbest(X?j ) .\\n\\nj=i+1\\n\\nj=0\\n\\ng(S) is the cost from the initial state to S; it corresponds to the sum of scores of the already assigned\\nparent sets.\\nh(S) is the estimated cost from S to the goal. It is the sum of the best assignable parent sets for the\\nremaining variables. Variable Xa can have Xb as parent only if Xb ? Xa .\\nThe A* approach requires the h function to be admissible. The function h is admissible if the\\nestimated cost is never greater than the true cost to the goal state. Our approach satisfies this property\\nsince the true cost of each step (score of chosen parent set for X?i+1 ) is always equal to or greater\\nthan the estimated one (the score of the best selectable parent set for X?i+1 ).\\nThe previous discussion implies that h is consistent, meaning that for any state S and its successor\\nT , h(S) ? h(T ) + c(S, T ), where c(S, T ) is the cost of the edges added in T . The function f is\\nmonotonically non-decreasing on any path, and the algorithm is guaranteed to find the optimal path\\nas long as the goal state is reachable. Additionally there is no need to process a node more than once,\\nas no node will be explored a second time with a lower cost.\\n3.2\\n\\nk-G\\n\\nA very high number of variables might prevent the use of k-A*. For those cases we propose k-G as a\\ngreedy alternative approach, which chooses at each step the best local parent set. Given the set of\\nexisting k-clique in K as KC , we choose as parent set for X?i :\\n?X?i = argmax score(?) .\\n??c,c?KC\\n\\n3.3\\n\\nSpace of learnable DAGs\\n\\nA reverse topological order is an order {v1 , ...vn } over the vertexes V of a DAG in which each vi\\nappears before its parents ?i . The search space of our algorithms is restricted to the DAGs whose\\nreverse topological order, when used as variable elimination order, has treewidth k. This prevents\\nrecovering DAGs which have bounded treewidth but lack this property.\\nWe start by proving by induction that the reverse topological order has treewidth k in the DAGs\\nrecovered by our algorithms. Consider the incremental construction of the DAG previously discussed.\\nThe initial DAG Gk+1 is induced over k + 1 variables; thus every elimination ordering has treewidth\\nbounded by k.\\nFor the inductive case, assume that Gi?1 satisfies the property. Consider the next variable in the\\norder, X?i , where i ? {k + 2, ..., n}. Its parent set ??i is a subset of a k-clique in Ki?1 . The\\nonly neighbors of X?i in the updated DAG Gi are its parents ??i . Consider performing variable\\nelimination on the moral graph of Gi , using a reverse topological order. Then X?i will be eliminated\\nbefore ??i , without introducing fill-in edges. Thus the treewidth associated to any reverse topological\\norder is bounded by k. This property inductively applies to the addition also of the following nodes\\nup to X?n .\\n4\\n\\n\\fInverted trees An example of DAG non recoverable by our algorithms is the specific class of\\npolytrees that we call inverted trees, that is, DAGs with out-degree equal to one. An inverted tree\\nwith m levels and treewidth k can be built as follows. Take the root node (level one) and connect it to\\nk child nodes (level two). Connect each node of level two to k child nodes (level three). Proceed in\\nthis way up to the m-th level and then invert the direction of all the arcs.\\nFigure 1 shows an inverted tree with k=2 and m=3. It has treewidth two, since its moral graph\\nis constituted by the cliques {A,B,E}, {C,D,F}, {E,F,G}. The treewidth associated to the reverse\\ntopological order is instead three, using the order G, F, D, C, E, A, B.\\nB\\n\\nA\\n\\nD\\n\\nC\\n\\nE\\n\\nF\\nG\\n\\nFigure 1: Example of inverted tree.\\nIf we run our algorithms with bounded treewidth k=2, it will be unable to recover the actual inverted\\ntree. It will instead identify a high-scoring DAG whose reverse topological order has treewidth 2.\\n\\n4\\n\\nExperiments\\n\\nWe compare k-A*, k-G, S2, S2+ and TWILP in various experiments. We compare them through\\nan indicator which we call W-score: the percentage of worsening of the BIC score of the selected\\ntreewidth-bounded method compared to the score of the Gobnilp solver Cussens (2011). Gobnilp\\nachieves higher scores than the treewidth-bounded methods since it has no limits on the treewidth.\\nLet us denote by G the BIC score achieved by Gobnilp and by T the BIC score obtained by the given\\ntreewidth-bounded method. Notice that both G and T are negative. The W-score is W = G?T\\nG . W\\nstands for worsening and thus lower values of W are better. The lowest value of W is zero, while\\nthere is no upper bound.\\nWe adopt BIC as a scoring function. The reason is that an algorithm for approximate exploration of\\nthe parent sets (Scanagatta et al., 2015) allowing high in-degree even on large domains exists at the\\nmoment only for BIC.\\n4.1\\n\\nParent set score exploration\\n\\nBefore performing structural learning it is necessary to compute the scores of the candidate parent sets\\nfor each node (parent set exploration). The different structural learning methods are then provided\\nwith the same score of the parent sets.\\nA treewidth k implies that one should explore all the parent sets up to size k; thus the complexity of\\nparent set exploration increases exponentially with the treewidth. To let the parent set exploration\\nscale efficiently with large treewidths and large number of variables we apply the approach of\\nScanagatta et al. (2015). It guides the exploration towards the most promising parent sets (with size\\nup to k) without scoring them all. This is done on the basis of an approximated score function that is\\ncomputed in constant time. The actual score of the most promising parent sets is eventually computed.\\nWe allow 60 seconds of time for the computation of the scores of the parent set of each variable, in\\neach data set.\\n4.2\\n\\nOur implementation of S2 and S2+\\n\\nHere we provide some details of our implementation of S2 and S2+. The second phase of both S2\\nand S2+ looks for a DAG whose moralization is a subgraph of a chosen k-tree. For this task Nie et al.\\n(2014) adopt an approximate approach based on partial order sampling (Algorithm 2). We found that\\nusing Gobnilp for this task yields consistently slightly higher scores; thus we adopt this approach in\\nour implementation. We believe that it is due to the fact that constraining the structure optimization\\nto a subjacent graph of a k-tree results in a small number of allowed arcs for the DAG. Thus our\\nimplementation of S2 and S2+ finds the highest-scoring DAG whose moral graph is a subgraph of\\nthe provided k-tree.\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\f4.3\\n\\nLearning inverted trees\\n\\nAs already discussed our approach cannot learn an inverted tree with k parents per node if the given\\nbounded treewidth is k. In this section we study this worst-case scenario.\\nWe start with treewidth k = 2. We consider the number of variables n ? {21, 41, 61, 81, 101}. For\\neach value of n we generate 5 different inverted trees. To generate as inverted tree we first select a\\nroot variable X and add k parents to it as ?X ; then we continue by randomly choosing a leaf of the\\ngraph (at a generic iteration, there are leaves at different distance from X) and adding k parents to it,\\nuntil the the graph contains n variables.\\nAll variables are binary and we sample their conditional probability tables from a Beta(1,1). We\\nsample 10,000 instances from each generated inverted tree.\\n\\nW -score\\n\\nWe then perform structural learning with k-A*, k-G, S2, S2+ and TWILP setting k = 2 as limit on\\nthe treewidth. We allow each method to run for ten minutes. S2, S2+ and TWILP could in principle\\nrecover the true structure, which is prevented to our algorithms. The results are shown in Fig.2.\\nQualitatively similar results are obtained repeating the experiments with k = 4.\\n0.1\\n\\nS2\\nTWILP\\nS2+\\nk-G\\nk-A*\\n\\n0.05\\n0\\n20\\n\\n30\\n\\n40\\n\\n50\\n\\n60\\n\\n70\\n\\n80\\n\\n90\\n\\n100\\n\\nNumber of variables\\nFigure 2: Structural learning results when the actual DAGs are inverted trees (k=2). Each point\\nrepresent the mean W-score over 5 experiments. Lower values of the W -score are better.\\nDespite the unfavorable setting, both k-G and k-A* yield DAGs with higher score than S2, S2+ and\\nTWILP consistently for each value of n. For n = 20 they found a close approximation to the optimal\\ngraph. S2, S2+ and TWILP found different structures, with close score.\\nThus the limitation of the space of learnable DAGs does not hurt the performance of k-G and k-A*.\\nIn fact S2 could theoretically recover the actual DAG, but this is not feasible in practice as it requires\\na prohibitive number of samples from the space of k-trees. The exact solver TWILP was unable to\\nfind the exact solution within the time limit; thus it returned a best solution achieved in the time limit.\\nS2\\n\\nS2+\\n\\nk-G\\n\\nk-A*\\n\\nIterations 803150\\n3\\n7176\\n66\\nMedian\\n-273600 -267921 -261648 -263250\\nMax\\n-271484 -266593 -258601 -261474\\nTable 1: Statistics of the solutions yielded by different methods on an inverted tree (n = 100, k = 4).\\nWe further investigate the differences between methods in Table 1. Iterations is the number of\\nproposed solutions; for S2 and S2+ it corresponds to the number of explored k-trees, while for k-G\\nand k-A* it corresponds to the number of explored orders. During the execution, S2 samples almost\\none million k-trees. Yet it yields the lowest-scoring DAGs among the different methods. This can be\\nexplained considering that a randomly sampled k-tree has a low chance to cover a high-scoring DAG.\\nS2+ recovers only a few k-trees, but their scores are higher than those of S2. Thus the informative\\nscore is effective at driving the search for good k-trees; yet it does not scale on large data sets as we\\nwill see later. As for our methods, k-G samples a larger number of orders than k-A* does and this\\nallows it to achieve higher scores, even if it sub-optimally deals with each single order. Such statistics\\nshow a similar pattern also in the next experiments.\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\fDATASET\\n\\nVAR.\\n\\nnursery\\nbreast\\nhousing\\nadult\\nletter\\nzoo\\nmushroom\\nwdbc\\naudio\\ncommunity\\nhill\\n\\n9\\n10\\n14\\n15\\n17\\n17\\n22\\n31\\n62\\n100\\n100\\n\\nGOBNILP\\n\\nTWILP\\n\\nS2\\n\\nS2+\\n\\nk-G\\n\\nk-A*\\n\\n-72159\\n-2698\\n-3185\\n-200142\\n-181748\\n-608\\n-53104\\n-6919\\n-2173\\n-77555\\n-1277\\n\\n?72159\\n?2698\\n-3213\\n-200340\\n-190086\\n-620\\n-68298\\n-7190\\n-2277\\n\\n?72159\\n?2698\\n-3252\\n-201235\\n-189539\\n-620\\n-68670\\n-7213\\n-2283\\n-107252\\n-1641\\n\\n?72159\\n?2698\\n-3247\\n-200926\\n-186815\\n-619\\n-64769\\n-7209\\n-2208\\n-88350\\n-1427\\n\\n?72159\\n?2698\\n-3206\\n-200431\\n-183369\\n-615\\n-57021\\n-7109\\n-2201\\n-82633\\n-1284\\n\\n?72159\\n?2698\\n?3203\\n?200363\\n?183241\\n?613\\n?55785\\n?7088\\n?2185\\n?82003\\n?1279\\n\\nTable 2: Comparison of the BIC scores yielded by different algorithms on the data sets analyzed by\\nNie et al.

As the data sets\\nbecomes larger, both k-A* and k-G achieve higher scores than S2, S2+ and TWILP (which does not\\nachieve the exact solution).

Thus for each treewidth we run 10?3=30 structural learning experiments.\\nWe let each method run for one hour. For S2+, we adopt a more favorable approach, allowing it to\\nrun for one hour; if after one hour the first k-tree was not yet solved, we allow it to run until it has\\nsolved the first k-tree.\\nIn Table 4 we report how many times each method wins against another for each treewidth, out\\nof 30 experiments. The entries are boldfaced when the number of victories of an algorithm over\\nanother is statistically significant (p-value <0.05) according to the sign-test.

In this case we show that the\\nparameter estimation problem can be essentially reduced to considering\\ndirections of arrival and attenuations of each signal. The paper presents\\ntwo demixing methods operating in the time and frequency domain and\\nexperimentally shows that it is always possible to demix signals arriving at\\ndifferent angles. Moreover, one can use spatial cues to solve the channel\\nselection problem and a post-processing Wiener filter to ameliorate the\\nartifacts caused by demixing.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\nBlind source separation (BSS) is capable of dramatic results when used to separate mixtures\\nof independent signals. The method relies on simultaneous recordings of signals from two\\nor more input sensors and separates the original sources purely on the basis of statistical\\nindependence between them. Unfortunately, BSS literature is primarily concerned with the\\nidealistic instantaneous mixing model.\\nIn this paper, we formulate a low dimensional and fast solution to the problem of separating\\ntwo signals from a mixture recorded using two closely spaced receivers. Using a physical\\nmodel of the mixing process reduces the complexity of the model and allows one to identify\\nand to invert the mixing process using second order statistics only.\\nWe describe the theoretical basis of the new approach, and then focus on two algorithms,\\nwhich were implemented and successfully applied to extensive sets of real-world data. In\\nessence, our separation architecture is a system of adaptive directional receivers designed\\nusing the principles ofBSS. The method bears resemblance to methods in beamforming [8]\\nin that it works by spatial filtering. Array processing techniques [2] reduce noise by\\nseparating signal space from noise space, which necessitates more receivers than emitters.\\nThe main differences are that standard beamforming and array processing techniques [8,\\n2] are generally strictly concerned with processing directional narrowband signals. The\\ndifference with BSS [7, 6] is that our approach is model-based and therefore the elements\\nof the mixing matrix are highly constrained: a feature that aids in the robust and reliable\\nidentification of the mixing process.\\n\\n\\fJ.

Sections 2 and 3 describe the theoretical foundation of\\nthe separation method that was pursued. Section 4 presents algorithms that were developed\\nand experimental results. Finally we summarize and conclude this work.\\n\\n2 Theoretical foundation for the BSS solution\\nAs a first approximation to the general multi-path model, we use the delay-mixing model.\\nIn this model, only direct path signal components are considered. Signal components from\\none source arrive with a fractional delay between the time of arrivals at two receivers. By\\nfractional delays, we mean that delays between receivers are not generally integer multiples\\nof the sampling period. The delay depends on the position of the source with respect\\nto the receiver axis and the distance between receivers. Our BSS algorithms demix by\\ncompensating for the fractional delays. This, in effect, is a form of adaptive beamforming\\nwith directional notches being placed in the direction of sources of interference [8]. A more\\ndetailed account of the analytical structure of the solutions can be found in [1].\\nBelow we address the case of two inputs and two outputs but there is no reason why the\\ndiscussion cannot be generalized to multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Assume a linear\\nmixture of two sources, where source amplitude drops off in proportion to distance:\\n\\nXi(t) =\\n\\n1\\n\\n- S I (t\\n\\n-\\n\\nR-I\\n_Z )\\n\\nRil\\n\\n1\\n+ -S2(t\\n-\\n\\nC\\n\\nRi2\\n\\nR-2\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n_Z )\\n\\nC\\n\\nj = 1, 2, where c is the speed of wave propagation, and Rij indicates the distance from\\nreceiver i to source j.

The criterion we use is to sort sources in order of increasing delay.\\nNote that the correspondence between delays and sources is unique when sources are not\\nsymmetrical with respect to the receiver axis.

In order to implement exactly the theoretical demixing procedure presented one\\nhas to divide by the determinant of the mixing matrix. Obviously one could filter using the\\ninverse of the determinant to obtain optimal results. This can be implemented in the form\\nof a Wiener filter. The Wiener filter requires knowledge both ofthe signal and noise power\\nspectral densities. This information is not available to us but a reasonable approximation is\\nto assume that the (wideband) sources have a flat spectral density and the noise corrupting\\nthe mixtures is white.

Applying\\nthis choice of filter usually dramatically improves the quality of the separated outputs.\\nThe technique of postprocessing using the determinant of the mixing matrix is perfectly\\ngeneral and applies equally well to demixtures computed using matrices of FIR filters.\\nThe quality of the result depends primarily on the care with which the inverse filter is\\nimplemented. It also depends on the accuracy of the estimate for the mixing parameters.\\nOne should avoid using the Wiener filter for near-degenerate mixtures.\\nThe proof of concept for the theory outlined above was obtained using speech signals which\\nif anything pose a greater challenge to separation algorithms because of the correlation\\nstructure of speech. Two kinds of data are considered in this paper: synthetic direct\\npropagation delay data and synthetic mUlti-path data. Data can be characterized along\\ntwo dimensions of difficulty: synthetic vs. real-world, and direct path vs. multi-path.\\nCombinations along these dimensions represented the main type of data we used.\\nThe value of distance between receivers dictates the order of delays that can appear due\\nto direct path propagation, which is used by the demixing algorithms. Data was generated\\nsynthetically employing fractional delays corresponding to the various positions of the\\nsources [3].\\nWe modeled multi-path by taking into account the decay in signal amplitude due to propagation distance as well as the absorption of waves. Only the direct path and one additional\\npath were considered.\\nThe algorithms developed proved successful for separation of two voices from direct path\\nmixtures, even where the sources had very similar spectral power characteristics, and for\\nseparation of one source for multi-path mixtures. Moreover, outputs were free from artifacts\\nand were obtained with modest computational requirements.\\nFigure 1 presents mean separation results of the first and second channels, which correspond\\nto the first and second sources, for various synthetic data sets. Separation depends on the\\nangles of arrival. Plots show no separation in the degenerate case of equal or closeby\\nangles of arrival, but more than lOdB mean separation in the anechoic case and 5dB in the\\nmUlti-path case.\\n\\n\\f780\\n\\nJ.

For accurate labeling it is important to\\ncapture the global context of the image as well as local information. We introduce a CRF based scene labeling model that incorporates both local features\\nand features aggregated over the whole image or large sections of it. Secondly,\\ntraditional CRF learning requires fully labeled datasets which can be costly and\\ntroublesome to produce. We introduce a method for learning CRFs from datasets\\nwith many unlabeled nodes by marginalizing out the unknown labels so that the\\nlog-likelihood of the known ones can be maximized by gradient ascent. Loopy\\nBelief Propagation is used to approximate the marginals needed for the gradient and log-likelihood calculations and the Bethe free-energy approximation to\\nthe log-likelihood is monitored to control the step size. Our experimental results\\nshow that effective models can be learned from fragmentary labelings and that\\nincorporating top-down aggregate features significantly improves the segmentations. The resulting segmentations are compared to the state-of-the-art on three\\ndifferent image datasets.\\n\\n1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nIn visual scene interpretation the goal is to assign image pixels to one of several semantic classes or\\nscene elements, thus jointly performing segmentation and recognition. This is useful in a variety of\\napplications ranging from keyword-based image retrieval (using the segmentation to automatically\\nindex images) to autonomous vehicle navigation [1].\\nRandom field approaches are a popular way of modelling spatial regularities in images. Their applications range from low-level noise reduction [2] to high-level object or category recognition (this\\npaper) and semi-automatic object segmentation [3]. Early work focused on generative modeling using Markov Random Fields, but recently Conditional Random Field (CRF) models [4] have become\\npopular owing to their ability to directly predict the segmentation/labeling given the observed image\\nand the ease with which arbitrary functions of the observed features can be incorporated into the\\ntraining process. CRF models can be applied either at the pixel-level [5, 6, 7] or at the coarser level\\nof super-pixels or patches [8, 9, 10]. In this paper we label images at the level of small patches, using\\nCRF models that incorporate both purely local (single patch) feature functions and more global ?context capturing? feature functions that depend on aggregates of observations over the whole image or\\nlarge regions.\\nTraditional CRF training algorithms require fully-labeled training data. In practice it is difficult\\nand time-consuming to label every pixel in an image and most of the available image interpretation\\ndatasets contain unlabeled pixels. Working at the patch level exacerbates this problem because\\nmany patches contain several different pixel-level labels. Our CRF training algorithm handles this\\nby allowing partial and mixed labelings and optimizing the probability for the model segmentation\\nto be consistent with the given labeling constraints.\\n1\\n\\n\\fThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: we describe our CRF model in Section 2, present our\\ntraining algorithm in Section 3, provide experimental results in Section 4, and conclude in Section 5.\\n\\n2\\n\\nA Conditional Random Field using Local and Global Image Features\\n\\nWe represent images as rectangular grids of patches at a single scale, associating a hidden class label\\nwith each patch. Our CRF models incorporate 4-neighbor couplings between patch labels. The local\\nimage content of each patch is encoded using texture, color and position descriptors as in [10]. For\\ntexture we compute the 128-dimensional SIFT descriptor [11] of the patch and vector quantize it\\nby nearest-neighbour assignement against a ks = 1000 word texton dictionary learned by k-means\\nclustering of all patches in the training dataset. Similarly, for color we take the 36-D hue descriptor\\nof [12] and vector quantize it against a kh = 100 word color dictionary learned from the training\\nset. Position is encoded by overlaying the image with an m ? m grid of cells (m = 8) and using the\\nindex of the cell in which the patch falls as its position feature. Each patch is thus coded by three\\nbinary vectors with respectively ks , kh and kp = m2 bits, each with a single bit set corresponding to\\nthe observed visual word. Our CRF observation functions are simple linear functions of these three\\nvectors. Generatively, the three modalities are modelled as being independent given the patch label.\\nThe naive Bayes model of the image omits the 4-neighbor couplings and thus assumes that each\\npatch label depends only on its three observation functions. Parameter estimation reduces to trivially\\ncounting observed visual word frequencies for each label class and feature type. On the MSRC 9class image dataset this model returns an average classification rate of 67.1% (see Section 4), so\\nisolated appearance alone does not suffice for reliable patch labeling.\\nIn recent years models based on histograms of visual words have proven very successful for image categorization (deciding whether or not the image as a whole belongs to a given category of\\nscenes) [13]. Motivated by this, many of our models take the global image context into account\\nby including observation functions based on image-wide histograms of the visual words of their\\npatches. The hope is that this will help to overcome the ambiguities that arise when patches are classified in isolation. To this end, we define a conditional model for patch labels that incorporates both\\nlocal patch level features and global aggregate features. Let xi ? {1, . . . , C} denote the label of\\npatch i, yi denote the W -dimensional concatenated binary indicator vector of its three visual words\\n(W\\nP = ks + hh + kp ), and h denote the normalized histogram of all visual words in the image, i.e.\\npatches i yi normalized to sum one. The conditional probablity of the label xi is then modeled as\\n\\u0010 P\\n\\u0011\\nW\\np(xi = l|yi , h) ? exp ? w=1 (?wl yiw + ?wl hw ) ,\\n(1)\\nwhere ?wl , ?wl are W ? C matrices of coefficients to be learned. We can think of this as a multiplicative combination of a local classifier based on the patch-level observation yi and a global\\ncontext or bias based on the image-wide histogram h.\\nTo account for correlations among spatially neighboring patch labels, we add couplings between the\\nlabels of neighboring patches to the single patch model (1). Let X denote the collection of all patch\\nlabels in the image and Y denote the collected patch features. Then our CRF model for the coupled\\npatch labels is:\\n\\u0001\\np(X|Y ) ? exp ? E(X|Y ) ,\\n(2)\\nE(X|Y ) =\\n\\nW\\nXX\\ni\\n\\n(?wxi yiw + ?wxi hw ) +\\n\\nw=1\\n\\nX\\n\\n?ij (xi , xj ),\\n\\n(3)\\n\\ni?j\\n\\nwhere i ? j denotes the set of all adjacent (4-neighbor) pairs of patches i, j. We can write E(X|Y )\\nwithout explicitly including h as an argument because h is a deterministic function of Y .\\nWe have explored two forms of pairwise potential:\\n?ij (xi , xj ) = ?xi ,xj [xi 6= xj ], and ?ij (xi , xj ) = (? + ? dij ) [xi 6= xj ],\\nwhere [?] is one if its argument is true and zero otherwise, and dij is some similarity measure over the\\nappearance of the patches i and j. In the first form, ?xi ,xj is a general symmetric weight matrix that\\nneeds to be learned. The second potential is designed to favor label transitions at image locations\\nwith high contrast. As in [3] we use dij = exp(?kzi ? zj k2 /(2?)), with zi ? IR3 denoting the\\naverage RGB value in the patch and ? = hkzi ? zj k2 i, the average L2 norm between neighboring\\nRGB values in the image. Models using the first form of potential will be denoted ?CRF?? and\\nthose using the second will be denoted ?CRF? ?, or ?CRF?? if ? has been fixed to zero. A graphical\\nrepresentation of the model is given in Figure 1.\\n2\\n\\n\\fFigure 1: Graphical representation of the\\nmodel with a single image- wide aggregate\\nfeature function denoted by h. Squares\\ndenote feature functions and circles denote variable nodes xi (here connected\\nin a 4- neighbor grid covering the image).

This requires completely labeled training data, i.e.\\na collection of N pairs (Xn , Yn )n=1,...,N with completely known Xn . In practice this is restrictive\\nand it is useful to develop methods that can learn from partially labeled examples ? images that\\ninclude either completely unlabeled patches or ones with a retricted but nontrivial set of possible\\nlabels. Formally, we will assume that an incomplete labeling X is known to belong to an associated set of admissible labelings A and we maximise the log- likelihood for the model to predict any\\nlabeling in A:\\nX\\nL = log p(X ? A | Y ) = log\\np(X|Y )\\nX?A\\n\\n= log\\n\\n\\u0010X\\n\\nexp ? E(X|Y )\\n\\n\\u0001\\u0011\\n\\nX?A\\n\\n? log\\n\\n\\u0010X\\n\\n\\u0001\\u0011\\n\\nexp ? E(X|Y )\\n\\n.\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nX\\n\\nNote that the log- likelihood is the difference between the partition functions of the restricted and\\nunrestricted labelings, p(X | Y, X ? A) and p(X|Y ). For completely labeled training images this\\nreduces trivially to the standard labeled log- likelihood, while for partially labeled ones both terms\\nof the log- likelihood are typically intractable because the set A contains O(C k ) distinct labelings\\nX where k is the number of unlabeled patches and C is the number of possible labels. Similarly,\\nto find maximum likelihood parameter estimates using gradient descent we need to calculate partial\\nderivatives with respect to each parameter ? and in general both terms are again intractable:\\n\\u0011 ?E(X|Y )\\nX\\u0010\\n?L\\n=\\n.\\n(5)\\np(X|Y ) ? p(X | Y, X ? A)\\n??\\n??\\nX\\n\\nHowever the situation is not actually much worse\\nP than the fully- labeled case. In any case we need to\\napproximate the full partition function log( X exp ?E(X|Y )) or\\nP its derivatives and any method\\nfor doing so can also be applied to the more restricted sum log( X?A exp ?E(X|Y )) to give a\\ncontrast- of- partition- function based approximation. Here we will use the Bethe free energy approximation for both partition functions [14]:\\n\\u0001\\n\\u0001\\n(6)\\nL ? FBethe p(X|Y ) ? FBethe p(X | Y, X ? A) .\\nThe Bethe approximation is a variational method based on approximating the complete distribution p(X|Y ) as the product of its pair- wise marginals (normalized by single- node marginals) that\\nwould apply if the graph were a tree. The necessary marginals are approximated using Loopy Belief\\nPropagation (LBP) and the log- likelihood and its gradient are then evaluated using them [14]. Here\\nLBP is run twice (with the singleton marginals initialized from the single node potentials), once\\nto estimate the marginals of p(X|Y ) and once for p(X | Y, X ? A). We used standard undamped\\nLBP with uniform initial messages without encountering any convergence problems. In practice\\nthe approximate gradient and objective were consistent enough to allow parameter estimation using\\nstandard conjugate gradient optimization with adaptive step lengths based on monitoring the Bethe\\nfree- energy.\\nComparison with excision of unlabeled nodes. The above training procedure requires two runs\\nof loopy BP. A simple and often- used alternative is to discard unlabeled patches by excising nodes\\n3\\n\\n\\fClass and frequency\\nModel\\n\\nBuilding\\n16.1%\\n\\nGrass\\n32.4%\\n\\nTree\\n12.3%\\n\\nCow\\n6.2%\\n\\nSky\\n15.4%\\n\\nPlane\\n2.2%\\n\\nFace\\n4.4%\\n\\nCar\\n9.5%\\n\\nBike\\n1.5%\\n\\nPer Pixel\\n\\nIND loc only\\nIND loc+glo\\nCRF? loc only\\nCRF? loc+glo\\nCRF? loc+glo del unlabeled\\nCRF? loc only\\nCRF? loc+glo\\nCRF? loc only\\nCRF? loc+glo\\nSchroff et al.

This leaves a random\\nfield with one or more completely labeled connected components whose log-likelihood p(X 0 |Y 0 )\\nwe maximize directly using gradient based methods. Equivalently, we can use the complete model\\nbut set all of the pair-wise potentials connected to unlabeled nodes to zero: this decouples the labels\\nof the unlabeled nodes from the rest of the field. As a result p(X|Y ) and p(X | Y, X ? A) are\\nequivalent for the unlabeled nodes and their contribution to the log-likelihood in Eq. (4) and the\\ngradient in Eq. (5) vanishes.\\nThe problem with this approach is that it systematically overestimates spatial coupling strengths.\\nLooking at the training labelings in Figure 3 and Figure 4, we see that pixels near class boundaries often remain unlabeled. Since we leave patches unlabeled if they contain unlabeled pixels,\\nlabel transitions are underrepresented in the training data, which causes the strength of the pairwise\\ncouplings to be greatly overestimated. In contrast, the full CRF model provides realistic estimates\\nbecause it is forced to include a (fully coupled) label transition somewhere in the unlabeled region.\\n\\n4\\n\\nExperimental Results\\n\\nThis section analyzes the performance of our segmentation models in detail and compares it to other\\nexisting methods.

About 30% of the pixels are unlabeled. Some sample images and labelings are shown in\\nFigure 4. In our experiments we divide the dataset into 120 images for training and 120 for testing,\\nreporting average results over 20 random train-test partitions. We used 20 ? 20 pixel patches with\\ncenters at 10 pixel intervals. (For the patch size see the red disc in Figure 4).\\nTo obtain a labeling of the patches, pixels are assigned to the nearest patch center. Patches are allowed to have any label seen among their pixels, with unlabeled pixels being allowed to have any\\nlabel. Learning and inference takes place at the patch level. To map the patch-level segmentation\\nback to the pixel level we assign each pixel the marginal of the patch with the nearest center. (In Figure 4 the segmentations were post-processed by a applying a Gaussian filter over the pixel marginals\\nwith the scale set to half the patch spacing). The performance metrics ignore unlabeled test pixels.\\nThe relative contributions of the different components of our model are summarized in Table 1.\\nModels that incorporate 4-neighbor spatial couplings are denoted ?CRF? while ones that incorporate\\nonly (local or global) patch-level potentials are denoted ?IND?. Models that include global aggregate\\nfeatures are denoted ?loc+glo?, while ones that include only on local patch-level features are denoted\\n?loc only?.\\n1\\n\\nAvailable from http://research.microsoft.com/vision/cambridge/recognition.\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\f85\\n\\nFigure 2: Classification accuracy as a\\nfunction of the aggregation fineness c, for\\nthe ?IND? (individual patch) classifier using a single training and test set. Aggregate features (AF) were computed in each\\ncell of a c ? c image partition. Results are\\ngiven for models with no AFs (solid line),\\nwith AFs of a single c (dotted curve), with\\nAFs on grids 1?1 up to c?c (solid curve),\\nand with AFs on grids c ? c up to 10 ? 10\\n(dashed curve).\\n\\nAccuracy\\n\\n80\\n\\nonly c\\n1 to c\\n\\n75\\n\\nc to 10\\nlocal only\\n\\n70\\n0\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n\\n6\\n\\n8\\n\\n10\\n\\nC\\n\\nBenefits of aggregate features. The first main conclusion is that including global aggregate features\\nhelps, for example improving the average classification rate on the MSRC dataset from 67.1% to\\n74.4% for the spatially uncoupled ?IND? model and from 80.7% to 84.9% for the ?CRF?? spatial\\nmodel.\\nThe idea of aggregation can be generalized to scales smaller than the complete image. We experimented with dividing the image into c ? c grids for a range of values of c. In each cell of the grid\\nwe compute a separate histogram over the visual words, and for each patch in the cell we include\\nan energy term based on this histogram in the same way as for the image-wide histogram in Eq. (1).\\nFigure 2 shows how the performance of the individual patch classifier depends on the use of aggregate features. From the dotted curve in the figure we see that although using larger cells to aggregate\\nfeatures is generally more informative, even fine 10 ? 10 subdivisions (containing only 6?12 patches\\nper cell) provide a significant performance increase. Furthermore, including aggregates computed\\nat several different scales does help, but the performance increment is small compared to the gain\\nobtained with just image-wide aggregates. Therefore we included only image-wide aggregates in\\nthe subsequent experiments.\\nBenefits of including spatial coupling. The second main conclusion from Table 1 is that including\\nspatial couplings (pairwise CRF potentials) helps, respectively increasing the accuracy by 10.5% for\\n?loc+glo? and by 13.6% for ?loc only? for ?CRF?? relative to ?IND?. The improvement is particularly\\nnoticeable for rare classes when global aggregate features are not included: in this case the single\\nnode potentials are less informative and frequent classes tend to be unduly favored due to their large\\na priori probability.\\nWhen the image-wide aggregate features are included (?loc+glo?), the simplest pairwise potential ?\\nthe ?CRF?? Potts model ? works better than the more general models ?CRF?? and ?CRF? ?, while\\nif only the local features are included (?loc only?), the class-dependent pairwise potential ?CRF??\\nworks best. The performance increment from global features is smallest for ?CRF??, the model\\nthat also includes local contextual information. The overall influence of the local label transition\\npreferences expressed in ?CRF?? appears to be similar to that of the global contextual information\\nprovided by image-wide aggregate features.\\nBenefits of training by marginalizing partial labelings. Our third main conclusion from Table 1\\nis that our marginalization based training method for handling missing labels is superior to the\\ncommon heuristic of deleting any unlabeled patches. Learning a ?CRF? loc+glo? model by removing\\nall unlabeled patches (?del unlabeled? in the table) leads to an estimate ? ? 11.5, whereas the\\nmaximum likelihood estimate of (4) leads to ? ? 1.9. In particular, with ?delete unlabeled? training\\nthe accuracy of the model drops significantly for the classes plane and bike, both of which have\\na relatively small area relative to their boundaries and thus many partially labeled patches. It is\\ninteresting to note that even though ? has been severely over-estimated in the ?delete unlabeled?\\nmodel, the CRF still improves over the individual patch classification obtained with ?IND loc+glo?\\nfor most classes, albeit not for bike and only marginally for plane.\\nRecognition as function of the amount of labeling. We now consider how the performance drops\\nas the fraction of labeled pixels decreases. We applied a morphological erosion operator to the manual annotations, where we varied the size of the disk-shaped structuring element from 0, 5, . . . , 50.\\n5\\n\\n\\f85\\n\\nAccuracy\\n\\ndisc 0\\n\\n75\\n\\ndisc 10\\n\\ndisc 20\\n\\n80\\n\\n70\\n65\\n60\\n\\nCRF? loc+glo\\nIND loc+glo\\n20\\n\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\nPercentage of pixels labeled\\n\\nFigure 3: Recognition performance when learning from increasingly eroded label images (left).\\nExample image with its original annotation, and erosions thereof with disk of size 10 and 20 (right).\\nIn this way we obtain a series of annotations that resemble increasingly sloppy manual annotations,\\nsee Figure 3. The figure also shows the recognition performance of ?CRF? loc+glo? and ?IND\\nloc+glo? as a function of the fraction of labeled pixels. In addition to its superior performance when\\ntrained on well labeled images, the CRF maintains its performance better as the labelling becomes\\nsparser. Note that ?CRF? loc+glo? learned from label images eroded with a disc of radius 30 (only\\n28% of pixels labeled) still outperforms ?IND loc+glo? learned from the original labeling (71% of\\npixels labeled). Also, the CRF actually performs better with 5 pixels of erosion than with the original labeling, presumably because ambiguities related to training patches with mixed pixel labels are\\nreduced.\\nComparison with related work. Table 1 also compares our recognition results on the MSRC\\ndataset with those reported in [15, 10]. Our CRF model clearly outperforms the approach of [15],\\nwhich uses aggregate features of an optimized scale but lacks spatial coupling in a random field,\\ngiving a performance very similar to that of our ?IND loc+glo? model. Our CRF model also performs\\nslightly better than our generative approach of [10], which is based on the same feature set but differs\\nin its implementation of image-wide contextual information ([10] also used a 90%?10% training-test\\npartition, not 50%-50% as here).\\nUsing the Sowerby dataset and a subset of the Corel dataset we also compare our model with two\\nCRF models that operate at pixel-level. The Sowerby dataset consists of 104 images of 96 ? 64\\npixels of urban and rural scenes labeled with 7 different classes: sky, vegetation, road marking, road\\nsurface, building, street objects and cars. The subset of the Corel dataset contains 100 images of\\n180 ? 120 pixels of natural scenes, also labeled with 7 classes: rhino/hippo, polar bear, water, snow,\\nvegetation, ground, and sky. Here we used 10 ? 10 pixel patches, with a spacing of respectively 2\\nand 5 pixels for the Sowerby and Corel datasets. The other parameters were kept as before. Table 2\\ncompares the recognition accuracies averaged over pixels for our CRF and independent patch models\\nto the results reported on these datasets for TextonBoost [7] and the multi-scale CRF model of [5].\\nIn this table ?IND? stands for results obtained when only the single node potentials are used in the\\nrespective models, disregarding the spatial random field couplings. The total training time and test\\ntime per image are listed for the full CRF models. The results show that on these datasets our model\\nperforms comparably to pixel-level approaches while being much faster to train and test since it\\noperates at patch-level and uses standard features as opposed to the boosting procedure of [7].\\n\\n5\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nWe presented several image-patch-level CRF models for semantic image labeling that incorporate\\nboth local patch-level observations and more global contextual features based on aggregates of observations at several scales. We showed that partially labeled training images could be handled by\\nmaximizing the total likelihood of the image segmentations that comply with the partial labeling,\\nusing Loopy BP and Bethe free-energy approximations for the calculations. This allowed us to learn\\neffective CRF models from images where only a small fraction of the pixels were labeled and class\\ntransitions were not observed.

The ambiguity\\nis defined as the variation of the output of ensemble members averaged over unlabeled data, so it quantifies the disagreement among\\nthe networks. It is discussed how to use the ambiguity in combination with cross-validation to give a reliable estimate of the ensemble\\ngeneralization error, and how this type of ensemble cross-validation\\ncan sometimes improve performance. It is shown how to estimate\\nthe optimal weights of the ensemble members using unlabeled data.\\nBy a generalization of query by committee, it is finally shown how\\nthe ambiguity can be used to select new training data to be labeled\\nin an active learning scheme.\\n\\n1\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nIt is well known that a combination of many different predictors can improve predictions. In the neural networks community \"ensembles\" of neural networks has been\\ninvestigated by several authors, see for instance [1, 2, 3]. Most often the networks\\nin the ensemble are trained individually and then their predictions are combined.\\nThis combination is usually done by majority (in classification) or by simple averaging (in regression), but one can also use a weighted combination of the networks .\\n.. Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Email: kroghlnordita. elk\\n\\n\\x0c232\\n\\nAnders Krogh, Jesper Vedelsby\\n\\nAt the workshop after the last NIPS conference (December, 1993) an entire session\\nwas devoted to ensembles of neural networks ( \"Putting it all together\", chaired by\\nMichael Perrone) . Many interesting papers were given, and it showed that this area\\nis getting a lot of attention .\\nA combination of the output of several networks (or other predictors) is only useful\\nif they disagree on some inputs. Clearly, there is no more information to be gained\\nfrom a million identical networks than there is from just one of them (see also\\n[2]). By quantifying the disagreement in the ensemble it turns out to be possible\\nto state this insight rigorously for an ensemble used for approximation of realvalued functions (regression). The simple and beautiful expression that relates the\\ndisagreement (called the ensemble ambiguity) and the generalization error is the\\nbasis for this paper, so we will derive it with no further delay.\\n\\n2\\n\\nTHE BIAS-VARIANCE TRADEOFF\\n\\nAssume the task is to learn a function J from RN to R for which you have a sample\\nof p examples, (xiJ , yiJ), where yiJ = J(xiJ) and J.t = 1, . . . ,p. These examples\\nare assumed to be drawn randomly from the distribution p(x) . Anything in the\\nfollowing is easy to generalize to several output variables.\\nThe ensemble consists of N networks and the output of network a on input x is\\ncalled va (x). A weighted ensemble average is denoted by a bar , like\\n\\nV(x) =\\n\\nL Wa Va(x).\\n\\n(1)\\n\\na\\n\\nThis is the final output of the ensemble. We think of the weight Wa as our belief in\\nnetwork a and therefore constrain the weights to be positive and sum to one. The\\nconstraint on the sum is crucial for some of the following results.\\nThe ambiguity on input x of a single member of the ensemble is defined as aa (x)\\n(V a(x) - V(x))2 . The ensemble ambiguity on input x is\\n\\na(x)\\n\\n= Lwaaa(x) = LWa(va(x) a\\n\\nV(x))2 .\\n\\n=\\n\\n(2)\\n\\na\\n\\nIt is simply the variance of the weighted ensemble around the weighed mean, and\\nit measures the disagreement among the networks on input x. The quadratic error\\nof network a and of the ensemble are\\n\\n(J(x) - V a(x))2\\n(J(x) - V(X))2\\n\\n(3)\\n(4)\\n\\nrespectively. Adding and subtracting J( x) in (2) yields\\n\\na(x)\\n\\n=L\\n\\nWafa(X) - e(x)\\n\\n(5)\\n\\na\\n\\n(after a little algebra using that the weights sum to one) . Calling the weighted\\naverage of the individual errors ?( x) = La Wa fa (x) this becomes\\n\\ne(x)\\n\\n= ?(x) -\\n\\na(x).\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\x0cNeural Network Ensembles, Cross Validation, and Active Learning\\n\\n233\\n\\nAll these formulas can be averaged over the input distribution . Averages over the\\ninput distribution will be denoted by capital letter, so\\n\\nJ dxp(xVl! (x)\\nJ dxp(x)aa(x)\\nJ dxp(x)e(x).\\n\\nE\\n\\n(7)\\n(8)\\n(9)\\n\\nThe first two of these are the generalization error and the ambiguity respectively\\nfor network n , and E is the generalization error for the ensemble. From (6) we then\\nfind for the ensemble generalization error\\n(10)\\nThe first term on the right is the weighted average of the generalization errors of\\nthe individual networks (E = La waEa), and the second is the weighted average\\nof the ambiguities (A = La WaAa), which we refer to as the ensemble ambiguity.\\nThe beauty of this equation is that it separates the generalization error into a term\\nthat depends on the generalization errors of the individual networks and another\\nterm that contain all correlations between the networks . Furthermore, the correlation term A can be estimated entirely from unlabeled data, i. e., no knowledge is\\nrequired of the real function to be approximated. The term \"unlabeled example\" is\\nborrowed from classification problems, and in this context it means an input x for\\nwhich the value of the target function f( x) is unknown.\\nEquation (10) expresses the tradeoff between bias and variance in the ensemble ,\\nbut in a different way than the the common bias-variance relation [4] in which the\\naverages are over possible training sets instead of ensemble averages. If the ensemble\\nis strongly biased the ambiguity will be small , because the networks implement very\\nsimilar functions and thus agree on inputs even outside the training set. Therefore\\nthe generalization error will be essentially equal to the weighted average of the\\ngeneralization errors of the individual networks. If, on the other hand , there is a\\nlarge variance , the ambiguity is high and in this case the generalization error will\\nbe smaller than the average generalization error . See also [5].\\nFrom this equation one can immediately see that the generalization error of the\\nensemble is always smaller than the (weighted) average of the ensemble errors,\\nE < E. In particular for uniform weights:\\n\\nE\\n\\n~ ~ \\'fEcx\\n\\n(11)\\n\\nwhich has been noted by several authors , see e.g. [3] .\\n\\n3\\n\\nTHE CROSS-VALIDATION ENSEMBLE\\n\\nFrom (10) it is obvious that increasing the ambiguity (while not increasing individual\\ngeneralization errors) will improve the overall generalization. We want the networks\\nto disagree! How can we increase the ambiguity of the ensemble? One way is to\\nuse different types of approximators like a mixture of neural networks of different\\ntopologies or a mixture of completely different types of approximators.

The final ensemble output (solid smooth curve) and\\nthe outputs of the individual networks (dotted curves) are shown. Also the square\\nroot of the ambiguity is shown (dash-dot line) _ For training 200 random examples\\nwere used, but each network had a cross-validation set of size 40, so they were each\\ntrained on 160 examples.\\n\\nobvious way is to train the networks on different training sets. Furthermore, to be\\nable to estimate the first term in (10) it would be desirable to have some kind of\\ncross-validation. This suggests the following strategy.\\nChose a number K :::; p. For each network in the ensemble hold out K examples for\\ntesting, where the N test sets should have minimal overlap, i. e., the N training sets\\nshould be as different as possible. If, for instance, K :::; piN it is possible to choose\\nthe K test sets with no overlap. This enables us to estimate the generalization error\\nE(X of the individual members of the ensemble, and at the same time make sure\\nthat the ambiguity increases . When holding out examples the generalization errors\\nfor the individual members of the ensemble, E(X, will increase, but the conjecture\\nis that for a good choice of the size of the ensemble (N) and the test set size\\n(K), the ambiguity will increase more and thus one will get a decrease in overall\\ngeneralization error.\\nThis conjecture has been tested experimentally on a simple square wave function\\nof one variable shown in Figure 1. Five identical feed-forward networks with one\\nhidden layer of 20 units were trained independently by back-propagation using 200\\nrandom examples. For each network a cross-validation set of K examples was held\\nout for testing as described above. The \"true\" generalization and the ambiguity were\\nestimated from a set of 1000 random inputs. The weights were uniform, w(X\\n1/5\\n(non-uniform weights are addressed later).\\n\\n=\\n\\nIn Figure 2 average results over 12 independent runs are shown for some values of\\n\\n\\x0cNeural Network Ensembles, Cross Validation, and Active Learning\\n\\nFigure 2: The solid line shows the generalization error for uniform weights as\\na function of K, where K is the size\\nof the cross-validation sets. The dotted\\nline is the error estimated from equation (10) . The dashed line is for the\\noptimal weights estimated by the use of\\nthe generalization errors for the individual networks estimated from the crossvalidation sets as described in the text.\\nThe bottom solid line is the generalization error one would obtain if the individual generalization errors were known\\nexactly (the best possible weights).\\n\\n0.08\\n\\n235\\n\\n,-----r----,--~---r-----,\\n\\no\\n\\nt=\\nw\\n0.06\\n\\nc\\n\\no\\n~\\n\\n.!::!\\n\\nco...\\n\\n~ 0.04\\n\\nQ)\\n\\n(!)\\n\\n0 .02 \\'---_---1_ _---\\'-_ _--\\'-_ _-----\\'\\no\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\nSize of CV set\\n\\nK (top solid line) . First, one should note that the generalization error is the same\\nfor a cross-validation set of size 40 as for size 0, although not lower, so it supports\\nthe conjecture in a weaker form. However, we have done many experiments, and\\ndepending on the experimental setup the curve can take on almost any form, sometimes the error is larger at zero than at 40 or vice versa. In the experiments shown,\\nonly ensembles with at least four converging networks out of five were used . If all\\nthe ensembles were kept, the error would have been significantly higher at ]{ = a\\nthan for K > a because in about half of the runs none of the networks in the ensemble converged - something that seldom happened when a cross-validation set\\nwas used. Thus it is still unclear under which circumstances one can expect a drop\\nin generalization error when using cross-validation in this fashion.\\n\\nThe dotted line in Figure 2 is the error estimated from equation (10) using the\\ncross-validation sets for each of the networks to estimate Ea, and one notices a\\ngood agreement.\\n\\n4\\n\\nOPTIMAL WEIGHTS\\n\\nThe weights Wa can be estimated as described in e.g. [3]. We suggest instead\\nto use unlabeled data and estimate them in such a way that they minimize the\\ngeneralization error given in (10) .\\nThere is no analytical solution for the weights , but something can be said about\\nthe minimum point of the generalization error. Calculating the derivative of E as\\ngiven in (10) subject to the constraints on the weights and setting it equal to zero\\nshows that\\nEa - Aa\\nE or Wa = O.\\n(12)\\n\\n=\\n\\n(The calculation is not shown because of space limitations, but it is easy to do.)\\nThat is, Ea - Aa has to be the same for all the networks. Notice that Aa depends\\non the weights through the ensemble average of the outputs. It shows that the\\noptimal weights have to be chosen such that each network contributes exactly waE\\n\\n\\x0c236\\n\\nAnders Krogh, Jesper Vedelsby\\n\\nto the generalization error. Note, however, that a member of the ensemble can have\\nsuch a poor generalization or be so correlated with the rest of the ensemble that it\\nis optimal to set its weight to zero.\\nThe weights can be \"learned\" from unlabeled examples, e.g. by gradient descent\\nminimization of the estimate of the generalization error (10). A more efficient\\napproach to finding the optimal weights is to turn it into a quadratic optimization\\nproblem. That problem is non-trivial only because of the constraints on the weights\\n(L:a Wa = 1 and Wa 2:: 0). Define the correlation matrix,\\nC af3\\n\\n=\\n\\nf\\n\\ndxp(x)V a (x)V f3 (x) .\\n\\n(13)\\n\\nThen, using that the weights sum to one, equation (10) can be rewritten as\\nE\\n\\n=\\n\\nL\\na\\n\\nwa Ea\\n\\n+ L w a C af3 w f3 - L\\naf3\\n\\nwaCaa .\\n\\n(14)\\n\\na\\n\\nHaving estimates of E a and C af3 the optimal weights can be found by linear programming or other optimization techniques. Just like the ambiguity, the correlation\\nmatrix can be estimated from unlabeled data to any accuracy needed (provided that\\nthe input distribution p is known).\\nIn Figure 2 the results from an experiment with weight optimization are shown.\\nThe dashed curve shows the generalization error when the weights are optimized as\\ndescribed above using the estimates of Ea from the cross-validation (on K exampies). The lowest solid curve is for the idealized case, when it is assumed that the\\nerrors Ea are known exactly, so it shows the lowest possible error. The performance\\nimprovement is quite convincing when the cross-validation estimates are used.\\nIt is important to notice that any estimate of the generalization error of the individual networks can be used in equation (14). If one is certain that the individual\\nnetworks do not overfit, one might even use the training errors as estimates for\\nEa (see [3]). It is also possible to use some kind of regularization in (14), if the\\ncross-validation sets are small.\\n\\n5\\n\\nACTIVE LEARNING\\n\\nIn some neural network applications it is very time consuming and/or expensive\\nto acquire training data, e.g., if a complicated measurement is required to find the\\nvalue of the target function for a certain input. Therefore it is desirable to only use\\nexamples with maximal information about the function. Methods where the learner\\npoints out good examples are often called active learning.\\nWe propose a query-based active learning scheme that applies to ensembles of networks with continuous-valued output. It is essentially a generalization of query by\\ncommittee [6, 7] that was developed for classification problems. Our basic assumption is that those patterns in the input space yielding the largest error are those\\npoints we would benefit the most from including in the training set.\\nSince the generalization error is always non-negative, we see from (6) that the\\nweighted average of the individual network errors is always larger than or equal to\\nthe ensemble ambiguity,\\nf(X) 2:: a(x),\\n(15)\\n\\n\\x0cNeural Network Ensembles.

The dots in the left plot show the results of the individual\\nexperiments contributing to the mean for the active learning. The dots in right plot\\nshow the same for passive learning.\\n\\nwhich tells us that the ambiguity is a lower bound for the weighted average of the\\nsquared error. An input pattern that yields a large ambiguity will always have a\\nlarge average error. On the other hand, a low ambiguity does not necessarily imply\\na low error. If the individual networks are trained to a low training error on the\\nsame set of examples then both the error and the ambiguity are low on the training\\npoints. This ensures that a pattern yielding a large ambiguity cannot be in the close\\nneighborhood of a training example. The ambiguity will to some extent follow the\\nfluctuations in the error. Since the ambiguity is calculated from unlabeled examples\\nthe input-space can be scanned for these areas to any detail. These ideas are well\\nillustrated in Figure 1, where the correlation between error and ambiguity is quite\\nstrong, although not perfect.\\nThe results of an experiment with the active learning scheme is shown in Figure 3.\\nAn ensemble of 5 networks was trained to approximate the square-wave function\\nshown in Figure 1, but in this experiments the function was restricted to the interval\\nfrom - 2 to 2. The curves show the final generalization error of the ensemble in a\\npassive (dashed line) and an active learning test (solid line). For each training set\\nsize 2x40 independent tests were made, all starting with the same initial training\\nset of a single example. Examples were generated and added one at a time. In the\\npassive test examples were generated at random, and in the active one each example\\nwas selected as the input that gave the largest ambiguity out of 800 random ones.\\nFigure 3 also shows the distribution of the individual results of the active and\\npassive learning tests. Not only do we obtain significantly better generalization by\\nactive learning, there is also less scatter in the results. It seems to be easier for the\\nensemble to learn from the actively generated set.\\n\\n\\x0c238\\n\\n6\\n\\nAnders Krogh. Jesper Vedelsby\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe central idea in this paper was to show that there is a lot to be gained from\\nusing unlabeled data when training in ensembles. Although we dealt with neural\\nnetworks, all the theory holds for any other type of method used as the individual\\nmembers of the ensemble.\\nIt was shown that apart from getting the individual members of the ensemble to\\ngeneralize well, it is important for generalization that the individuals disagrees as\\nmuch as possible, and we discussed one method to make even identical networks\\ndisagree. This was done by training the individuals on different training sets by\\nholding out some examples for each individual during training. This had the added\\nadvantage that these examples could be used for testing, and thereby one could\\nobtain good estimates of the generalization error.\\nIt was discussed how to find the optimal weights for the individuals of the ensemble.\\nFor our simple test problem the weights found improved the performance of the\\nensemble significantly.\\n\\nFinally a method for active learning was described, which was based on the method\\nof query by committee developed for classification problems. The idea is that if the\\nensemble disagrees strongly on an input, it would be good to find the label for that\\ninput and include it in the training set for the ensemble. It was shown how active\\nlearning improves the learning curve a lot for a simple test problem.\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nWe would like to thank Peter Salamon for numerous discussions and for his implementation of linear programming for optimization of the weights.
